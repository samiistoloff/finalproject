Which option for the final project are you choosing -- 1, 2, or 3? — 2


THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE FOR EVERYONE. (Though they may be easier if you are choosing Option 1 or 2, because you can reference the Option 1 or 2 instructions.)

* What will at least one of the classes you're going to define be called?

Movie

* What will that class take as input to its constructor?

Dictionary, representing a movie

* What will 1 instance of this class represent?

Information from the movie

* What are 3 instance variables this class will have? What will they be called, and what information will they hold? Why are they important?

Title- string, the title of the movie
Director- string, who directs the movie
IMDB rating - int, how well its rated versus other movies, can be changed to str.

* Explain 2 methods the class will have that are not the class constructor (__init__ method) by answering the following questions for each. 
ONE METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?

__str__

- What will the method do?

Turn any integer data into str data to be stored in a dictionary

- Will it take any additional input? 

No

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 

Will return any non-string information as a string, will not change anything about the instance variables. 

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?


Helps to put out and translate the information about the  movie users are searching for into a single string. It simplifies the data and helps users to look in one place for information instead of many places. The single string will contain summaries, year released, title, actor, and anything else that might be of use to the user. 


ANOTHER METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?

get_year

- What will the method do?

It will return the year that the movie was released

- Will it take any additional input? 

No

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable?
 

Will return the value of the release year, doesn’t change anything


- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?


You can call this method .get_year and it will return the value of the year the movie was released. This year can be saved in a separate variable, such as movie_year and then you can call on a different class to get data from twitter that is relevant to this year.  It is simpler to call a method from one class and use the outputs from these methods as inputs for other classes. 

[If you definitely want to have a third, feel free to answer those questions a third time, because you'll have to do so eventually. when you write documentation!]


* What will the tables in your database be?

Tweets, Users, Movies

* What fields will each database table have? Which field of them is the primary key? You should list the fields for each database table here, e.g.
Tweets:
- text ... 
(etc.)

Tweets: Text, ID (primary key), twitter_user (Users), movie_association, retweet_num, favorite_num

Users: ID (primary key), user_handle, user_faves, etc.

Movies: ID (primary key), movie_title, director, rating, lead_actor_male, lead_actor_female


* List, in English, 2 queries you'll want to make from your database. At least one should be a JOIN. You can always change these later, but start with  ideas you're interested in and lessen the work on yourself later on! 
(e.g. from class examples, maybe "I want to make a query that accesses the numbers of times each user has favorited tweets, and the number of times tweets that user posted have been favorited -- so I'll be joining the Tweets table and the Users table")

I want to make a query that accesses the the title of a movie, the movie’s rating, and the top actor and actress in the movie where the rating is above a 4.5/5; this involves the Movie table.  

I want to make a query that accesses the top male or female actor in a specific movie and the last 20 tweets they made; this joins the User table and Movie table.


* What are at least 2 of the data processing mechanics you're planning to use? 

Dictionary accumulation and set comprehension.


* Why will each of those be useful to you? What data might you use it on? 
(e.g. "Set comprehension: I think I'm going to be looking for unique names and proper nouns in this big set of text, so I'm going to use a set comprehension"). 
>>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<

Dictionary accumulation: I think I’m going to be looking for the most popular words associated with an actor’s name, associating that word with the actor.

Set Comprehension: I think I’m going to be looking for how many users tweeted about a single movie title, and set comprehension will be useful so make sure that each user is only accounted for once. 


* What will your output look like? Will it be a .txt file? a CSV file? something else? What information will it contain? >>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<

My output will be a .txt file containing information on the most popular movies that are being talked about right now.  It will contain information form the 5 most talked about movies from the past month.
